/**
 * Demo 4: The <Sketchpad> Pattern (Chain-of-Thought in Structured Outputs)
 *
 * Modern models are smart enough to catch obvious bugs even without time to think.
 * But if a model outputs a direct verdict as its first token, it is a BLACK BOX.
 * If it gets it wrong, you have no idea why.
 *
 * By adding a `thought_process` string as the VERY FIRST field in your Zod schema,
 * you force the LLM to output its step-by-step reasoning. This provides an AUDIT
 * TRAIL for debugging, evaluations, and human oversight. It's not just about
 * accuracy; it's about observability.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/week-02/demo-04-sketchpad.js

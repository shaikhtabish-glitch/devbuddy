# DevBuddy — Setup Guide (Python)

Follow these steps to get DevBuddy running on your machine.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later (`python --version`)
- Git
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (fast Python package manager, recommended)
- `make` (optional; macOS/Linux only. On Windows use `python install.py`)
- An OpenRouter API key (check `#devbuddy-series` or contact the ops team)

Install uv once:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Windows (PowerShell):
# powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

---

## Quick Path (recommended)

From the `python/` directory, one command does the whole setup: creates the virtual environment, installs the Week 0 dependencies, and scaffolds your `.env`. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux and needs nothing but Python.

```bash
cd python
python install.py
# then edit python/.env, add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY, and:
python run.py
```

On macOS/Linux with `make` installed, `make install` and `make run` do the same thing. That's it. The steps below explain it in detail.

---

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh repo fork org/devbuddy --clone

# Or via GitHub UI: click Fork -> Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devbuddy.git
cd devbuddy
```

---

## Step 2: Add Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/org/devbuddy.git
```

Each week you'll run `git fetch upstream` and check out that week's branch (see "Branch Layout" below).

---

## Step 3: Set Up the Python Environment

We use uv for fast, reproducible installs. The Week 0 dependency set is intentionally small, so this installs in seconds.

```bash
cd python
python install.py   # creates .venv, installs Week 0 deps, scaffolds .env (Windows/macOS/Linux)
```

If you prefer to run the steps yourself:

```bash
cd python
uv venv                          # creates .venv, picks Python 3.11+
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Later weeks pull heavier libraries. Install them only when you reach that week:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[rag]"       # Week 3 (RAG: chromadb, embeddings, ...)
uv pip install -e ".[mcp]"       # Week 5 (MCP)
uv pip install -e ".[agent]"     # Week 6 (Agent: langgraph)
```

<details>
<summary>No uv either? Plain venv + pip still works</summary>

```bash
cd python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

---

## Step 4: Configure Your API Key

`make install` already copied `.env.example` to `.env` for you. Open `python/.env` and set your key:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-actual-key
```

(If you set up manually, run `cp .env.example .env` first.)

**Never commit `.env` to git.** It's in `.gitignore`. Your key is loaded automatically from `python/.env` at runtime, so no manual `export` is needed.

---

## Step 5: Run the Verification Script

```bash
python run.py
# same as: uv run python src/verification.py  (or `make run` on macOS/Linux)
```

You should see output like:

```
============================================================
  DevBuddy Verification — Week 0
============================================================

[1/3] Checking: auth-service...
  Status:      passing
  Confidence:  30%
  Reason:      I don't have real CI access...
  Tokens:      147 (102 in / 45 out)
  Cost:        $0.000042
  Time:        1.23s
  Type:        BuildCheck ← typed object, not a string!

============================================================
  ✅ VERIFICATION PASSED
============================================================
```

## Step 6: Post to the Channel

Copy your terminal output and post it to `#devbuddy-series` with one sentence:

> *"I want DevBuddy to help me with _____."*

---

## Branch Layout — One Branch Per Week

This repo uses **one branch per week**. `main` is the Week 0 baseline: stub files you build from. Each `week-NN` branch is that week's worked checkpoint. It adds `docs/week-NN.md`, the pre-reading, the completed solution under `src/`, and test fixtures under `shared/`.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout week-02        # switch to a specific week's materials
```

Available now: `week-01` through `week-06` (Week 6 = Agentic Workflows is the latest). If you miss a session, check out the next week's branch to get a clean starting point.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `make: command not found` | You're likely on Windows (`make` is a Unix tool). Use `python install.py` then `python run.py` instead. No make needed. |
| `uv: command not found` | Fine. `python install.py` falls back to venv + pip automatically. Install uv only if you want faster setups. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set` | The key is auto-loaded from `python/.env`. Make sure `python/.env` exists and contains your real key (not the placeholder from `.env.example`). |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: langchain_openai` | Run `python install.py` from the `python/` directory. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: src` | Run from the `python/` directory: `cd python && python run.py`. |
| `python: command not found` | Use `python3` (e.g. `python3 install.py`). |
| Verification script times out | Check your network. OpenRouter may be rate-limited on shared keys. |
| Anything else | Post in `#devbuddy-series`. Don't DM — public debugging builds shared knowledge. |

## What's Next

- Week 1 is the kick-off session. You'll see the full DevBuddy architecture.
- The verification script you just ran is a microcosm of what DevBuddy becomes.
- Each week: `git fetch upstream && git checkout week-NN`, read `docs/week-NN.md`, build in `python/src/`.
